# Hello ochre!

## Library Structure

When developing with ochre, you will primarily work in the `game/` folder. This is where all of the code you implement will go. When running make from the ochre folder it will compile `game/Game.cpp` and `game/Game.h` in order to run your game. Currently those files will contain our sample game code.

Inside the `game/` folder, you will also find the skeleton code `Game-template.cpp` and `Game-template.h` that outline the essential parts of the `Game` class.

## Implementing Your Code

After successfuly completing the test, you can remove the current `Game.cpp` and `Game.h`, or move them somewhere else if you would like to refer to them later. Then rename `Game-template.cpp` to `Game.cpp` and `Game-template.h` to `Game.h`.
