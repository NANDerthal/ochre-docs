# Writing Documentation

When developing for ochre, make sure to write documentation for the functionality you introduce and/or change. There are three main methods of documentation: [code commenting](#code-commenting), [the GitHub readme](#readme.md), and [Read the Docs](#read-the-docs) (this website).

Our goals and standards for each method of documentation are outlined below.

## Code commenting

We are currently deciding on a consistent style for code commenting, and will update this section once we have done so.

[//]: # (TODO: research commenting styles and pick one)

## README.md

This is the readme on the [ochre GitHub repo](https://github.com/NANDerthal/ochre). It is intended to give a very brief overview of what ochre is, with brief instructions and links for how to get started and get help. It is not intended to be an extensive or detailed guide or reference.

## Read the Docs

The documentation you are reading right now is hosted on [readthedocs.io](https://readthedocs.io). We have attempted to make this documentation both easily accessible and detailed enough to satisfy the needs of more advanced users who want to delve into the engine source.
