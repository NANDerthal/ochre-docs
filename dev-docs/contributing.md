# Contributing


We appreciate any and all efforts to help improve ochre. However, currently, we are still building the core of the engine, and need to finish this before considering any source contributions. Once this is complete, we will add documentation about how to contribute, so stay tuned!

## Useful Resources

Although it is entirely possible to assist in development without knowing about the underlying libraries used in ochre, it will likely become necessary to learn more about OpenGL and SDL2 if you want to contribute more extensively.

To that end, here are some resources that the current developers have found to be especially useful.

OpenGL:

* [Learn OpenGL](http://learnopengl.com/)

SDL2:

* [Lazy Foo's SDL2 tutorials](http://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/index.php)
